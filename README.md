# GO FAIR Ontology

This repository contains GO FAIR foundational ontology modelled on top of Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) using the OntoUML language.
It's goal is to define key terms and their relations, independent on any implementation considerations, i.e. to provide ontological clarification.

## The Model

The model is elaborated in [Visual Paradigm Community Edition](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/editions/community/).
